# Day 6: Upgrading Previous Work

Welcome to Day 6 of my 30-day code challenge! Today, I focused on enhancing the work I've done in the past two days. I've upgraded and improved the features implemented on Day 4 and Day 5.

## Highlights:

1. **Stylish Navigation:** Implemented a sleek navigation bar for easier access to different sections of the website.

2. **Enhanced Profile Section:** Made improvements to the profile section, including profile picture display and follower-following count.

3. **Optimized Posts Display:** Refactored the post section to display posts more efficiently and elegantly.

## Code Repository:

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for more updates and improvements as I continue my 30-day code challenge journey. Tomorrow, I'll be diving into new features and enhancements to further elevate my project.
