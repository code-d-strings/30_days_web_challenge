# 30 Days Web Challenge

Welcome to my 30 Days Web Challenge repository! ðŸš€

## Overview
This repository contains my progress throughout a 30-day web development challenge. Each day, I'll be working on different aspects of web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.

## Day 4 Update: Social Network Layout
For day 4 of the challenge, I've created a basic layout for a social network. This includes sections for the user profile, news feed, and chat. It's just the beginning, and there's a lot more to come!

### Features Implemented:
- Profile section with user information and friends list.
- News feed section with posts and comment functionality.
- Chat section with a basic messaging interface.

### Planned Enhancements:
- Add interactivity and functionality to profile and news feed sections.
- Improve styling for better user experience.
- Implement backend functionality for user authentication and data storage.
