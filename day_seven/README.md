# 30 Days Code Challenge: Day 7 - Signup Page

Welcome to Day 7 of my 30-day code challenge! Today, I've created a simple signup page using HTML and CSS. This signup page features fields for full name, email, and password. It's designed with a clean and elegant appearance, utilizing the colors white, black, and gold.

## Features

- Responsive design: The signup page is designed to be responsive and adapt to various screen sizes.
- Stylish appearance: The page has a modern and elegant look with a gold background for the form.
- Basic validation: HTML5 form validation ensures that required fields are filled out before submission.

## Usage

To use the signup page, open the `signup.html` file in a web browser. Fill in the required fields (full name, email, and password), and click the "Sign Up" button to submit the form.

## Fancy Signup Form

In addition to the signup page, I've also created a fancy signup form project. Below is more information about it:
